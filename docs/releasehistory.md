# Release History

Releases follow the ``major.minor.micro`` scheme recommended by
[PEP440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#final-releases), where

* `major` increments denote a change that may break API compatibility with previous `major` releases
* `minor` increments add features but do not break API compatibility
* `micro` increments represent bugfix releases or improvements in documentation
