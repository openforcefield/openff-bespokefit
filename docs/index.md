# OpenFF BespokeFit

BespokeFit is an automated solution for creating bespoke force field parameters for 
small molecules of interest in the [SMIRNOFF-format] that can be used seamlessly with
more general force fields (such as Parsley and Sage) that are based on SMIRNOFF. 

It is a Python library in the [Open Force Field ecosystem] that emphasises:

* **accuracy**: by training highly specific force field parameters to data that is bespoke
  to molecules that are of most interest, such as candidate drug molecules, a much higher level
  of accuracy can be achieved than a general force field will achieve

* **efficiency**: built-in advanced techniques such as [automated chemical fragmentation] enable
  the framework to rapidly generate bespoke quantum chemical training data at a fraction of the cost 
  while retaining accuracy without any additional user intervention

* **ease of use**: bespoke fitting using well tested, opinionated default settings can be easily performed
  directly from the command line without touching a line of Python 

:::{warning}
Please note that BespokeFit is experimental, pre-production software. It does
not promise to have a stable API and may in cases produce inaccurate results. 
We are always looking to improve this framwork so if you do find any undesirable 
or irritating behaviour, please [file an issue!]
