# Theory

BespokeFit produces optimized classical molecular force field parameters for user-specified molecules. These "bespoke"
parameters aim to be highly accurate, and support for efficiently computing parameters for multiple similar molecules,
such as a lead series, is included. This page describes the theory behind the production of these parameters, as well
as the assumptions and trade-offs BespokeFit makes.

The process by which bespoke parameters are generated generally follows five main stages:

1. **Parameter selection** - features of the molecule(s) that require bespoke parameters, such as rotatable bonds, are
    identified
2. **Fragmentation** - molecules are split into smaller fragments based on the identified features for faster quantum
    chemical calculations
3. **QC generation** - any required quantum chemical reference data is generated using the smaller chemical fragments 
4. **Parameter generation** - bespoke SMIRKS patterns that match the identified chemical features are constructed and
    initial values sourced from a general force field
5. **Parameter optimization** - the bespoke parameters are trained to fit the reference QC data

## Parameter selection

The first stage in the bespoke fitting workflow is to identify the features of the molecule to optimize. BespokeFit
targets features that benefit the most from molecule-specific parametrization. At present, this involves identifying
all rotatable bonds in a molecule. Accurately reproducing the torsion profile around these bonds is critical to
ensuring that the correct conformational preferences of a molecule are captured.

:::

By default, we define a 'rotatable bond' as any bond that is not in a ring, and is between two 'non-terminal' atoms that
each do not participate in a triple bond. Any atoms that are bonded to at least two other non-hydrogen atoms are
considered to be non-terminal. See the [bespoke workflow factory chapter] and the[`target_torsion_smirks`] field for
details on overriding this definition of a 'rotatable bond'.

## Fragmentation

The second stage in the bespoke fitting workflow is to break the molecule of interest into smaller fragments.

Quantum chemical calculations are usually very computationally expensive, and their expense grows very quickly with the
number of atoms --- much more quickly than in molecular mechanics. A QC calculation with twice as many atoms generally
takes much more than twice as long to complete. Like launching rockets in stages for fuel economy, the default fitting
workflow breaks large molecules into fragments for computational economy. 

These fragments are designed to be as small as possible without significantly changing the important features of the
molecule identified in the first stage. To ensure the torsional profile of a rotatable bond is preserved, for example,
fragments are generated in such a way as to preserve the electronic environment around that bond. 

:::{figure-md} fig-fragments

Fragments generated from the above TYK2 ligand. The bond around which each fragment is built is highlighted and the
original molecule is in light gray. Note that some fragments are repeated because they share an electronically
decoupled region of the molecule.
:::

The default fitting workflow employs the Wiberg Bond Order{cite}`wbofrag` fragmentation engine made available by the
[`openff-fragmenter`] package, though another fragmenter [may be specified]. At present only torsion drives take
advantage of fragmentation, and one fragment will be generated for each rotatable bond identified by the previous
step.

## QC Generation

The third stage in the bespoke fitting workflow is generating any reference quantum chemical data that the bespoke
parameters will be trained to reproduce.

The default fitting workflow currently generates all reference data at the *B3LYP-D3BJ/DZVP* level of theory. This
balances computational efficiency against accurately reproducing conformations generated using higher levels of
theories. This is also the level of theory used in training the main OpenFF force fields, and so ensures that bespoke
and general parameters can be mixed with minimal compatibility concerns. 

:::{tip}
See the [quick start guide] for details on how to swap out the default level of theory for a faster surrogate, such as
ANI or XTB.

[quick start guide]: quick_start_chapter
:::

The types of quantum calculation that will be performed depend on the types of bespoke parameters to be generated. In
particular if generating bespoke:

* **torsion parameters**: a one dimensional torsion scan around each identified bond will be performed

<!-- add paragraph / subsection on torsion drives generated using torsion drive package using wavefront
<!-- propagation + nice figure? -->

<!-- 
- For high throughput bespoke parameter deviation we recommend using the fantastic QCFracal distributed computing and
  database for quantum chemistry.
- Users can easily set up a local server and submit large datasets of torsion drives using QCSubmit which can then be
  used as reference data by bespokefit via the cache update feature- need a section on how to pull down qcarchive data
  and cache locally. -->

## Parameter generation

The fourth stage in the bespoke fitting workflow is to generate an initial set of ready-to-train parameters for each of
the features identified in the first stage.

There are two aspects to this: we need to both select a sensible set of initial values for the parameter, and we need to
generate a SMIRKS pattern that describes the chemical environment that the parameter will be applied to. 

:::{note}
[SMIRKS]{cite}`smirks` patterns are used extensively within OpenFF force fields as a more flexible and robust
alternative to atom types.

### Selecting initial values

The initial values for the bespoke parameters are by default sourced from the "Rosemary" OpenFF 2.0.0 force field. This
is done by applying the general force field to the molecule of interest, inspecting which parameters from the general
force field were applied to the target features, and then copying the relevant values. For example, when selecting
initial torsion parameters for biphenyl, BespokeFit would check which general torsion parameters were assigned to the
central rotatable bond, and then copy the barrier height $k_i$, phase $\psi_i$ and periodicity $N$ of those parameters
over to the bespoke parameter.

By default, extra degrees of freedom will also be added so that the specificity of the bespoke parameters is not limited
by the starting force field. In the case of generating bespoke torsion parameters, the default fitting workflow will
augment the initial values so that it contains periodicities $n_i$ from 1 to 4.

$$U(\phi) = \sum_{i=1}^N k_i (1 + \cos(n_i \phi - \psi_i))$$

This can be configured in the [`smirk_settings`] field of the workflow factory. This is a conservative approach that is
often not needed; in these cases, added complexity is avoided because the barrier heights $k_i$ are kept close to zero
by the optimizer, which prefers solutions with simpler parameters.

### Generating bespoke SMIRKS

Generating a SMIRKS pattern involves a trade-off between specificity and transferability. Ideally the pattern would be
highly specific to the chemical environment in question while being transferable to other similar chemical
environments, such as the same torsion of a pharmacophore across several molecule in a lead series. While general force
fields favor generality, BespokeFit prefers specificity so that parameters can be highly optimized to the target.
SMIRKS patterns generated by BespokeFit are constructed to include as much information about as many atoms as possible
while being consistent across the parent molecule and any relevant fragments.

orange boldface. The `:1` -- `:4` suffixes in the SMIRKS patterns for these four atoms index them as defining the
torsion, while the remainder of the pattern identifies the chemistry. The atoms that vary between the fragment and
parent molecule are highlighted in blue and green; they are defined in the SMIRKS as a comma-separated list of possible
chemistries. The chemistry used by the parent molecule is italicized.
:::

#### Torsion SMIRKS

Torsion SMIRKS generation begins by grouping symmetric torsions and treating them together. By symmetry, these torsions
should have identical parameters, and this helps reduce the number of new parameters and simplify optimization.
BespokeFit accomplishes this by identifying the symmetry classes of atoms in the parent molecule with RDKit or OpenEye
and labeling torsions with the symmetry classes of their atoms. Two atoms will have the same symmetry class if and only
if they are symmetry-equivalent, so symmetric torsions are those that share a (possibly reversed) label.

:::{figure-md} fig-symmetry
![First fragment of 2,6-dichloro-~{N}-[2-(2-ethylbutanoylamino)-4-pyridyl]benzamide with symmetry classes and symmetry-equivalent torsions labelled.](img/theory/symmetry_classes.svg)

The first fragment of the ligand, labelled with symmetry classes. Atoms with the same symmetry class are
symmetry-equivalent. Below, two symmetry-equivalent torsions for the fragment are highlighted.
:::

Once a minimal set of symmetry-equivalent torsions are collected, SMIRKS patterns are generated with [ChemPer]. We
consider the fragments to be the minimum electronically decoupled substructure around each torsion which preserves the
local chemical environment. Hence, SMIRKS patterns are constructed to include the maximum common substructure between
the parent and fragment, making them as transferable as possible given complete specificity to their local chemical
environment. In particular, they are guaranteed to be transferable between parent and fragment and to other molecules
that share the computed fragment. 

As a result, the common cores of congeneric series like the ligands of TYK2(pictured) can be parameterized once and
cached. When a new molecule produces the same torsion SMIRKS, the parameter can be reused from the cache, saving the
significant computational effort associated with a torsion drive.

[above], which allows the torsion to be cached and reused.

## Optimization

The final stage in the bespoke fitting workflow is to optimize ("train") the bespoke parameters against the QC reference
data generating in the earlier stage.

The optimization first constructs a loss function to minimize. The loss function measures the deviations between a
trained result and the reference value. In BespokeFit, we refer to the different contributions to the loss function
as *'fitting targets'*. This terminology is consistent with the brilliant [ForceBalance] force field optimization
framework.

BespokeFit supports three main fitting targets, which measure the deviations of:

* **torsion profile**: the torsion profile computed by performing a torsion scan using the current force field
    parameters against the reference QC torsion profile.
* **vibrational frequency**: vibrational frequencies computed from MM hessian data against those computed from reference
    QC hessian calculations.
* **optimized geometry**: internal coordinates of a conformer of the molecule minimized using the current values of the
    force field against the same conformer minimized using QC methods. 

These are the same fitting targets that are used to produce the mainline OpenFF force fields, ensuring that any bespoke
parameters are compatible with those in the starting general force field. For more details, see the OpenFF 1.0.0
Parsley paper.{cite}`parsley`

Although in the future multiple optimization engines will be supported, by default the fitting workflow employs
[ForceBalance] to train the parameters against the fitting targets outlined above. ForceBalance employs a Bayesian
prior distribution to avoid over-fitting and to define the range of likely values the fitted parameter may take on.
{cite}`forcebalance` Any complexity added to the force field must overcome a penalty imposed by the prior distribution.
The Laplacian prior used by default is equivalent to an L1 regularizer, and is configured by setting a "prior width",
which sets the range over which the parameter can vary during optimization. BespokeFit defaults to quite large prior
widths on the torsion barrier heights ($k_i$) so that the optimization is not hindered by a very general reference
value.
