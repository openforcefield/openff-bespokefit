## Code of Conduct and Community Guidelines

OpenFF BespokeFit is part of an engaged and respectful community made up of
people from all over the world. Your involvement helps us to further our
mission and to create an open platform that serves a broad range of
communities, from research and education to industry and beyond. This diversity
is one of our biggest strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues
and conflicts. Therefore, we have a few ground rules we ask that our community
members adhere to.

Fundamentally, we are committed to providing a productive,
harassment-free environment for everyone. Rather than considering this
code an exhaustive list of things that you can't do, take it in the
spirit it is intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us
and the communities in which we participate.

Importantly: as a member of our community, you are also a steward of these
values. Not all problems need to be resolved via formal processes, and often a
quick, friendly but clear word on an online forum or in person can help resolve
a misunderstanding and de-escalate things.

By embracing the following principles, guidelines and actions to follow or
avoid, you will help us make OpenFF BespokeFit a welcoming and productive
community.

1. **Be friendly and patient**.

2. **Be welcoming**. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
   people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited
   to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color,
   immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex,
   sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, physical
   appearance, family status, political belief, technological or professional
   choices, academic discipline, religion, mental ability, and physical
   ability.

3. **Be considerate**. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
   will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
   and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
   making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community. You may be
   communicating with someone with a different primary language or cultural
   background.

4. **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement
   is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. We might all experience some
   frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into
   a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people
   feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

5. **Be careful in the words that you choose**. Be kind to others. Do not
   insult or put down other community members. Harassment and other
   exclusionary behaviors are not acceptable. This includes, but is not
   limited to:
   * threats or violent language directed against another person
   * discriminatory jokes and language
   * posting sexually explicit or violent material
   * posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
     information ("doxing")
   * personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms
   * unwelcome sexual attention, even if believed to be welcome
   * advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
   * repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop,
     then stop

6. **Moderate your expectations**. Many in our community volunteer their time.
   They are probably not purposefully ignoring issues, refusing to engage in
   discussion, avoiding features, etc. but often just unavailable.

7. **When we disagree, try to understand why**. Disagreements, both social and
   technical, happen all the time and OpenFF BespokeFit is no exception. It is
   important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
   Remember that we're different. The strength of OpenFF BespokeFit comes from 
   its varied community that includes people from a wide range of backgrounds.
   Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to
   understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean they're wrong. Don't
   forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us
   anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from
   mistakes.

8. **A simple apology can go a long way**. It can often de-escalate a
   situation, and telling someone that you are sorry is act of empathy that
   doesn't automatically imply an admission of guilt.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a
project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at josh.mitchell@openforcefield.org. 
The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond 
in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
